== Introduction

PlotSquared v5.12.0 introduced a new component preset system. The new system allows server owners to make component presets that players can then apply to their plots via a GUI. The GUI menu overrides player specific permissions. Thus, you can use the GUI to let players use components that they're not normally permitted to use.

== Components

The components available - and the values you can use - are the same as those in the `/plot set <component>` command.

.Available components:
* floor
* wall
* all
* air
* main
* middle
* outline
* border

More information can be found here: xref:plot-components.adoc[Plot Components]

== Configuration

The system is toggled in the `settings.yml` file under `enabled-components`. It is enabled by default.

Presets are configured in the file `plugins/PlotSquared/settings/components.yml`:

Messages are styled using https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html[MiniMessage]. To preview the outcome, you can use a tool like https://webui.adventure.kyori.net/[MiniMessageViewer].

presets:
  - component: floor
    cost: 0.0
    pattern: '##wool'
    name: <rainbow:2>Disco Floor</rainbow>
    icon: yellow_wool
    description:
      - <gold>Spice up your plot floor</gold>
    permission: ''
----

This is a powerful system as it allows you to use the power of xref:../block-bucket.adoc[BlockBuckets] to define block-patterns.

== Cost

If a non-zero cost is defined  and both https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/[Vault] and an economy plugin is present, the GUI will charge using the in-game currency.

== Icons

You can use any https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/item_id_list_pc.php[Minecraft material] as the preset icon.

== Permission

The player won't be able to see presets that they are not permitted to use. If the permission is set to `''` (an empty string) then all players will be able to use that preset.

== /plot components

The command for opening the GUI is `/plot components` and has the permission node `plots.components`.

Using this command will bring up the GUI menu, but only if the player is in a plot that they own.
